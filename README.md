# Effects of Dietary Fat and Fiber on the Gut Microbiome in the context of antibiotic-induced *C. difficle* Infection

This repository includes all files produced through QIIME2 microbiome profiling of 16S rDNA sequencing FASTQ files along with visualizations and statistical analysis run in R. Analysis was optimized through a pipeline generated in Snakemake, associated files are contained in the workflow directory. 

## Directory contents are as follows:
  - **Arizona Experiments Combined (az_exp_combined):** A re-run of lower QIIME2 16S rDNA sequencing analysis with the combination of cecal and stool sample data due to a lack of data points at sacrifice in the stool samples for the Arizona experiments (stool samples taken at sacrifice are filtered out, respectively). 
  - **Cecum:** 16S rDNA sequencing microbiome results, CD toxin, bile acid, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), histologic scores, and       hypoxia levels for mouse cecal contents at sacrifice from the Arizona experiments. 
  - **Comparisons:** A combination of baseline microbiome data from the Arizona experiments and new experiments conducted at CU Anschutz 
  to make comparisons between studies (soon to be combined with data from [this study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41522-022-00276-1#ref-CR67)).
  - **Figures:** Compiled manuscript figures, plots taken from all directories. 
  - **New Experiments (new_experiments):** Preliminary results of follow-up mouse experiments currently being conducted at CU Anschutz.
  - **Stool:** 16S rDNA sequencing microbiome results for mouse fecal stool samples taken throughout the experimental timeline to get a better picture of microbiome changes over time from the Arizona experiments.
  - **Workflow:** Contains the pipeline built for the purpose of this data analysis in Snakemake (tutorial coming soon!).
