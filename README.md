# Effects of Dietary Fat and Fiber on the Gut Microbiome in the context of antibiotic-induced *C. difficle* Infection

This repository includes all files produced through QIIME2 microbiome profiling of 16S rDNA sequencing FASTQ files along with visualizations and statistical analysis run in R. Analysis was optimized through a workflow pipeline generated in Snakemake, associated files are contained in the workflow subdirectory. 

## Directory contents are as follows:
  - Cecum: 16S rDNA sequencing microbiome results, CD toxin, bile acid, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), histologic scores, and hypoxia levels for mouse cecal contents at sacrifice. 
  - Colon: 16S rDNA sequencing microbiome results for mouse fecal stool samples taken throughout the experimental timeline to get a better picture of microbiome changes over time.
  - Comparisons: A re-run of lower QIIME2 16S rDNA sequencing analysis with the combination of cecal and fecal stool sample data due to a lack of data points at sacrifice in the fecal stool samples (fecal stool samples taken at sacrifice are filtered out, respectively).
  - Figures: Compiled manuscript figures, taken from the cecal and comparison directories. 
  - New Experiments: Preliminary results of follow-up mouse experiments currently being conducted.
