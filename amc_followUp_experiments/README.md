# AMC Follow-Up Mouse Experiments: Stool and Culture Samples

Holds all of the stool 16S sequencing outputs at days -15 and 3 along with the spleen, liver, and blood culture 16S sequencing outputs. Includes survival analysis and mouse weight data over the timeline. All data was collected from follow-up mouse experiments done at AMC (Anschutz Medical Campus).
