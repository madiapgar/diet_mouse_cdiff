# University of Arizona Mouse Experiment: Stool Samples

Holds all of the general 16S sequencing alpha/beta diversity and taxonomic relative abundance analysis done before stool results needed to be combined with cecal results due to lack of sampling in the high fiber diets at day 3 (`az_exp_combined/`). Survival results for the mice in these experiments are also included in this directory.
