## config file for previous amc, arizona and amc follow-up experiment stool sample comparisons at day -15 and day 3!
## previous amc experiment raw sequences/metadata are on qiita and were just demultiplexed/put through dada2 before 
## biom/rep seqs were combined with others for this analysis 

dataset_dir: "comparisons/"
qiime_env: "qiime2-2023.5"

## --GLOBAL OPTIONS--
## are you starting with raw 16S sequences?
raw_sequences: "no" ## options: yes and no 

## do you want to run taxonomic classification? chances are yes since you're running this workflow
tax_class: "yes" ## options: yes and no, default is yes 

## does your data need to go through total sum scaling? chances are that it doesn't
total_sum_scaling: "yes" ## options: yes and no

## do you want to run core metrics analysis on your data to get alpha/beta diversity? you HAVE to run this if you want the microbiome R outputs
core_metrics: "yes" ## options: yes and no

## would you like basic R plots/stats for your microbiome data? if so, this requires you to edit your R scripts directory for the exact visualizations you want
## (see more in the tutorial)
microbiome_r_outputs: "no" ## options: yes and no
